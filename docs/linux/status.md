# Migration status — 2026-10-14

Priority: subscription links and script execution behavior; player work deferred.

| Work | Status | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Win-Box checkout and working branch | Done | baseline.json; branch codex/linux-core |
| Android source candidate pinned | Done | TVBoxOS ab11d28: original 20-file snapshot plus HistoryHelper; seven auxiliary AOSP Android 13 source files pinned separately |
| Historical Win-Box APK/version identification | Unconfirmed | Source method references match named files/line ranges; no unified APK pin found |
| Executable original-source reference probe | Done for selected methods | scripts/compat/oracle.mjs |
| Synthetic reference observations | Done | 65 config + 75 subscription cases; crypto plaintext expectations generated independently with Node crypto |
| Probe and backend contract tests | Done | 163 Node tests passed, including temporary HTTP fixtures and worker lifecycle/failure checks |
| Win-Box comparison | Initial audit done | config-comparison.json |
| Explicit backend configuration core | Initial module implemented | backend/config-core; 140/140 selected-method cases match, including errors/partial state; full ApiConfig pending |
| Real Android/ART validation | Pending | No APK/device/emulator runtime verification |
| Subscription preparation/decrypt | Core stages implemented | URL/key, original FindResult/AES, AOSP JSON/Base64, clan/relative paths, collection recognition; persisted switching/cache and Android network/provider parity pending |
| JS/QuickJS/Python/JAR/native execution parity | Pending | Sources pinned; runtimes not ported |
| Linux container and NAS validation | Pending | Current host is macOS ARM64; no Docker available |

The 65-case audit contains 12 matching observations, 51 differing observations
and 2 cases where both sides reject but exception/state mapping is unresolved.
These are deliberately selected edge cases, often sharing the same underlying
cause. They are neither 51 separate bugs nor a real-world source compatibility
rate. No Android/Linux parity completion is claimed.

The supplied Fantaiying link was fetched successfully with an okhttp-style UA.
The declared MIME type was image/x-ms-bmp, while its magic bytes were JPEG and
its salt+base64 payload contained the configuration. A browser UA was redirected
to an HTML homepage. Selected original-source methods accepted all 48 source
definitions; the inventory contains 45 CSP/JAR and 3 JS sources. Source field
values still differ from desktop Win-Box. The new explicit backend's path fixing
and all 48 source-field results match the selected upstream methods on this
sample. No downloaded source code was executed.

Observed migration issues include null coercion, boolean/integer conversion,
partial numeric strings, list conversion stopping at invalid entries, raw timeout
storage, duplicate source keys, required-field failure behavior, Gson's lenient
syntax and the upstream whole-text relative-path replacement.

The independent backend uses committed Java sources and pinned Gson directly,
without importing the reference extractor or desktop engine. The 140-case backend
gate passes, as do 17 additional live-reference requests covering state changes,
numeric lexemes and path cases. This does not close the desktop audit or certify
the rest of ApiConfig. See config-pipeline.md for the stage-by-stage boundary.

The 75 subscription cases cover malformed URL/key splits, org.json-first decode
ordering, Base64 padding/skipped characters, independently generated ECB/CBC
ciphertexts, failed decrypt nulls, UTF-8 plaintext and collection coercion.
AOSP Android 13 helpers are an auxiliary source baseline motivated by compileSdk
33, not a pin of the user's Android OS. Bouncy Castle 1.78.1 is the desktop crypto
provider, not Android's provider. prepareSubscription composes the covered steps
without fetching, caching or running referenced code. The HTTP probe now uses
that pipeline, including removing configured keys from the actual request URL.

Next batch:

1. Extend original-source coverage to persisted collection/history and cache
   state transitions, then implement those stages around the config core.
2. Initialize controlled Spider/SpiderApi init and method fixtures; investigate
   JAR/DEX and JS execution against that contract.
3. Validate on Linux x86_64 and an Android runtime before claiming platform parity.
